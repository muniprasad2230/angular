		There are 3 ways that we can create a custom object

			- Object literal
			- Object Constructor
			- using predefined Object

			Note - * In ES5 Js there is no 'class' keyword but we can create class is also 'function' keyword. In ES6+ JS thers is class keyword.

			* ES5 JS supports 'Prototypal' Inheritance where as ES6+ JS supports 'Classical' inheritance.

	/* Object literal - Example */

	var institute = {
		firstname:'AchieversIT',
		lastname:'training institute',
		place:'located at BTM, Bangalore',
		details: function(){
			return this.firstname+' '+this.lastname+' '+this.place;
		},
		courses: function(){
			return "AchieversIT provides trainings on Fullstack, Ui, MERN,MEAN,DM,AWS,DevOps etc..."
		}
	}

	// retriving props and methods

	console.log(institute.firstname);//AchieversIT
	console.log(institute.firstname);//AchieversIT
	console.log(institute.firstname);//AchieversIT
	console.log(institute.courses());//AchieversIT provides trainings on Fullstack, Ui, MERN,MEAN,DM,AWS,DevOps etc...

	/* Object Constructor - Example */

	function student(name,email,pno){
		this.name =  name;
		this.email =  email;
		this.phone =  pno;
		this.enrollment = function(){
			return this.name+' has enrolled for Fullstack Development, his email id is '+this.email +' and his phone is '+this.phone;
		}
		this.details = function(){
			return this.name+","+this.email+","+this.phone;
		}
	}

	//retriving props as well methods

	var sObj = new student('Murali','murali@gmail.com','9060888029');

	console.log(sObj.name);//Murali
	console.log(sObj.enrollment()); //Murali has enrolled for Fullstack Development, his email id is murali@gmail.com and his phone is 9060888029

	var sObj1 = new student('Sachin','sachin@gmail.com','9090909090');
	console.log(sObj1.name);//Sachin

	/* Inheritance - Aquring props and members of base class into derived class */

	student.prototype.gender = 'male';
	student.prototype.enrolledFor = function(){
		return this.name+' has enrolled for online classes';
	}
	student.prototype.discount = function(fees,dp=10){
		return fees - (fees * dp / 100);
	}

	var sObj2 = new student('Dhoni','dhoni@gmail.com','8080808080');
	console.log(sObj2.name);//Dhoni

	console.log(sObj2.gender);

	console.log(sObj2.discount(25000,20));
	console.log(sObj2.discount(25000));
